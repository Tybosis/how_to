# How-To App

By Tyler Pottle

## Description

This project is a simple how-to app where users can create how-to lists, and
then add individual steps onto these lists.  Existing steps can be edited
and deleted, and new steps can also be added.  Lists can also be deleted, which
will also remove the associated steps for that list.

### Sources

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QVqojHFxs0) railscast on nested
resources really helped me to assign the proper routes to each action in the
steps controller.

The Railsguide for [routing](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html) was
also a great resource for me to try and understand how nested resources should
be routed with path helpers.
